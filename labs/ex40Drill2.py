       Colors weave into a spire of flame
       Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
       Bear this torch against the cold of the night
       Search your soul and reawaken the undying light!
       On that day when the sky fell away
       Our world came to an end
       In our eyes, did a fading sun rise
       In the dark glimmering shadows
       Silence grows in the spaces between
       Stretching out beyond time
       Rising up as a chorus of souls
       Find a voice
       lickering through the void
       These little sparks cling on to life
       Everyone caught in the struggle
       And then the storms of change
       They fan the flames
       Scattering ashes to the wind!
       Every soul contains a whisper of light
       leaming faintly as it dwindles from sight
       No escape, no greater fate to be made
       instant sparks call to a past still unnamed
       Bear this torch against the cold of the night
       Search your soul and reawaken the undying light!
       As fate spins
       A thread without end
       New life draws it's first breath
       Blossoming in a soil reclaimed from the past
       Where destiny holds fast
       Here where we stand
       Hand clenched in hand
       Everyone caught in the struggle
       This is the day we finally find our way
       Stepping into our tomorrow!
       Every soul contains a whisper of light
       Growing louder as it calls to unite
       From the distance sings a chorus of souls
       Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals
       Colors weave into a spire of flame
       Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
       Bear this torch against the cold of the night
       Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight!
       Every soul contains a whisper of light
       Growing louder as it calls to unite
       From the distance sings a chorus of souls
       Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals
       Colors weave into a spire of flame
       Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
       Bear this torch against the cold of the night
       Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight!
